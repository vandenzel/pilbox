    PIL-Box firmware - pilbox16.asm

The firmware version 1.6 is a fully functional version of the firmware of the HPIL/serial converter. It is released for documentation purpose, and for personal (not commercial) use. The hex and source files are provided for personal DIY projects and are copyright 'J-F Garnier, 2015'. It is *not* open source nor freeware. I do not provide any support.

This version is the last to use the PIC 16F628A MCU, it was used for several PIL-Box batches up to early 2016, it works well with the HP-41C and HP-71B (and other HP-IL machines as well), it provides the enhanced transfer speed (1.5 and later), the advanced service request management (1.6 and later), but not the fast 230 kbps communication speed (2.1 and later that are using the PIC 16F1826 MCU).
