# pilbox

Trying to translate the PIL-Box (http://www.jeffcalc.hp41.eu/hpil/#pilbox) from PIC16 to something that I understand

## Reason

Mainly because I'm used to AVR and Arduino platform, and chips and modules for that platform are more readily available for cheap (like the Pro Micro) I thought to try my hand on translating the PIC assembly code to C/C++. Initially for Arduino/AVR, maybe even for other processors.

## Possible imaginable future

- HP-IL over WiFi on an ESP32
